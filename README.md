#  File Sorter

A simple Python tool that automatically organizes files into folders such as Documents, Images, Videos, Audio, Archives, and Others.

This project helped me practice Python automation and build something useful for daily life.

##  Why I Built This
Downloads and Desktop folders quickly become messy.  
I built this tool so files automatically move into correct folders without manual work.

---

##  Features
- Automatically detects file types
- Creates folders if they don't exist
- Works on any folder
- Beginner-friendly, clean Python code

---

##  How It Works
The script reads each file, identifies its extension, and moves it into a matching folder:

Documents  
Images  
Videos  
Audio  
Archives  
Others

---

##  Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher

Check version:

python --version
