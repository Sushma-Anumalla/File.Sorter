# File Sorter

A simple Python tool that automatically organizes files in a folder by moving them into neatly labeled sub-folders — such as Documents, Images, Videos, Audio, Archives, and Others.

Perfect for cleaning messy Downloads, Desktop, or any directory in seconds.

## Features
- Automatically detects file types by extension
- Creates folders if they don’t already exist
- Can be reused for any folder
- Keeps your system organized and clutter-free
- Beginner-friendly Python project

## How It Works
The script scans the selected folder and moves files into categorized folders such as:

Documents  
Images  
Videos  
Audio  
Archives  
Others

You can easily modify categories or add new file types.
